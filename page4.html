       <p>I have a riddle for you to solve. Its really basic but give it a try</p>
       <p>I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. Do you know what i am? </p>

       <p>Now im not going to tell you the answer,but if you found it just know...thats what i am,lurking in everyone's shadows </p>
       <p>If you didnt, well i guess it will remain a mystery(unless you fucking google it you little rat)</p>
